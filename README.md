# Bezier-Canvas
Individual mini-project of the Graphic Processing (IF680). The project's objective was to create a Canvas able to create Bezier Curves, through De Casteljau's algorithm, along with other utility functionalities.  It was done initially in a pure HTML file and recently I converted it to a ReactJS app.
